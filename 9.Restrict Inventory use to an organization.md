# 1. Restrict use of an Inventory to a particular Organization

## Overview

Ansible Automation Platform allows users to enforce policies at multiple enforcement points, including:

* **Organization Level:** Affects all job templates within an Organization.
* **Inventory Level:** Affects all jobs using a specified Inventory.
* **Job Template Level:** Affects jobs launched from a specific Job Template.

This example demonstrates how to restrict the use of a certain Inventory to a particular Organization:

## Example Policy [aap_policy_examples/restrict_inv_use_to_org.rego](aap_policy_examples/restrict_inv_use_to_org.rego):

The following policy (`restrict_inv_use_to_org.rego`) blocks job execution entirely unless it's the 'Default' organization using the 'Demo Inventory' inventory.

```rego
package aap_policy_examples

import rego.v1

# Default policy response indicating allowed status with no violations
default organization_inventory_validation := {
    "allowed": true,
    "violations": [],
}

# Validate that only "Default" can use "Demo Inventory"
organization_inventory_validation := result if {
    # Extract values from input
    inventory_name := object.get(input, ["inventory", "name"], "")
    org_name := object.get(input, ["organization", "name"], "")

    # Check if inventory is "Demo Inventory"
    inventory_name == "Demo Inventory"

    # Check if organization is not "Default"
    org_name != "Default"

    result := {
        "allowed": false,
        "violations": ["Only the 'Default' organization should use the 'Demo Inventory' inventory"],
    }
}
```

## Enforcement Behavior

When applied at different enforcement points, this policy prevents job execution accordingly:

- **Job Template:** All jobs launched from the template will **ERROR**, preventing playbook execution.
- **Inventory:** All jobs using the inventory will **ERROR**, preventing playbook, preventing playbook execution.
- **Organization:** All jobs launch from job template that belongs to the organization will **ERROR**, preventing playbook execution.

This policy is recommended to be used at the **Inventory** policy enforcement level.

## Real World Use Case: Lock down the use of an Inventory to a particular Organization

### Scenario  

AAP ships with and by default installs a Demo Organization, Inventory and Credential. This should not be used for anything other than initial testing. This policy lets you check that someone in another Organization (MyOrg\_not\_Default) does not try to use the Demo Inventory.

## Impact of Policy Enforcement in Ansible Automation Platform  

By applying the Block Policy, Ansible Automation Platform completely prevents automation execution at the specified enforcement points. 
This ensures that no changes can be made to critical environments during security incidents, audits, or compliance reviews.  

## How AAP Enforces the Policy  

Running an automation Job Template when this policy is in place will result in this type of error:

```
This job cannot be executed due to a policy violation or error. See the following details:
{'Violations': {'Inventory': ["Only the 'Default' organization should use the "
                              "'Demo Inventory' inventory"]}}
```
